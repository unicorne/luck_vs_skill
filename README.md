# luck_vs_skill

The interplay of luck and skill in sports is a complicated and highly discussed topic. This paper aims to quantify and interpret the role of luck in various sport leagues. Using Classical Test Theory and the assumption that skill differences between teams become more apparent over the course of a season, the authors estimate luck contributions by comparing the variance of point distributions between actual and simulated results in a "luck-only" scenario.
